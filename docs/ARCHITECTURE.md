# agent-connector — Architecture

> Write your MCP server + hooks **once**. agent-connector detects every AI-agent
> platform on the machine, renders the right config in each one's native dialect,
> installs/syncs/uninstalls them, and gives you **default, platform-independent
> per-tool token telemetry** — the metric MCP developers actually want.

This document is the authoritative design. It is grounded in the understand-phase
report ([`docs/research/understand-report.md`](research/understand-report.md)),
which reverse-engineered context-mode's proven 15-platform adapter layer and the
real installed config formats across Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode,
VS Code/JetBrains Copilot, Gemini, Warp, Hermes, and more.

---

## 1. Problem

Every AI-agent host re-invents the same two integration surfaces — **MCP server
registration** and **lifecycle hooks** — with mutually incompatible config files,
root keys, formats (JSON / JSONC / TOML / YAML / exported TS-or-Python functions),
transports, scopes, and event vocabularies. A developer who wants reach must
hand-author and maintain N dialects, N hook adapters, and N install flows, then
chase each platform's quirks (Cursor silently fails on a wrong root key; VS Code
uses `servers` not `mcpServers`; Codex uses TOML `[mcp_servers.x]`; OpenCode wants
an exported TS plugin function, not a hook table). context-mode paid this cost in
full for a single server. agent-connector generalizes that work into a reusable
framework.

Second, **no host reports per-tool token usage back to an MCP server** (the MCP
spec has no `usage` on `CallToolResult`). So "how much context does installing my
server actually cost, everywhere?" — the question MCP devs care most about — is
unanswerable today. agent-connector answers it by measuring the server's own
bytes and tokenizing them locally, identically across all hosts.

## 2. Two pillars

1. **Single-API multi-platform deployment.** One declarative + programmatic
   `defineConnector({...})` → adapters render it into each platform's native MCP
   registration and hook config; one CLI installs/syncs/uninstalls everywhere.
2. **Default per-MCP token telemetry.** Platform-independent, local-first,
   privacy-preserving (aggregate counts, never content). On by default, opt-out
   granular.

## 3. Operating model — home-dir-centric, single binary, per-project data

This is the baseline the user mandated (oh-my-claudecode style), refined after
critical review. Three rules:

### R1 — One home binary; everything routes through it
The framework installs **one** runtime in the home root:

```
~/.agent-connector/                 (override: AGENT_CONNECTOR_DATA_DIR)
  bin/agent-connector               single binary — CLI + universal hook entrypoint + telemetry runtime
  connectors/<id>/connector.json    each registered connector's resolved definition
  telemetry.db (or telemetry.ndjson) shared store, rows keyed by project — see R3
  backups/                          timestamped settings backups before each mutation
  logs/
```

Every platform config we write is a **thin pointer back to this one binary**:
- a hook command is `agent-connector hook <platform> <event> --connector <id>`
  (mirrors context-mode's proven `context-mode hook <platform> <name>` dispatch);
- an MCP server entry runs the connector's server, optionally wrapped by
  `agent-connector serve --connector <id> -- <real server cmd>` so telemetry is
  captured with zero work from the dev.

Because the pointers reference one stable home path, **updating that single binary
updates behavior in every platform at once** — exactly the requested ergonomic.

> **Critical adjustment #1 — stable path, managed update (NOT silent auto-update).**
> A forced/silent auto-update of a single binary means one bad release breaks
> *every project × every platform* simultaneously (maximum blast radius, lost
> reproducibility) — the `npx pkg@latest` failure mode. So: pointers reference a
> **stable** path (`~/.agent-connector/bin/agent-connector`), never a versioned
> cache dir (this also sidesteps the whole class of bug that forces context-mode's
> `cache-heal` SessionStart hook). Updates are **explicit/managed**
> (`agent-connector upgrade`, channel = stable|latest), with an optional
> **per-project version pin** override. One place to update — without global
> instant breakage.

### R2 — "Home-centric" cannot be absolute; platforms force project/global scopes
Cursor, VS Code Copilot, etc. require config files at platform-mandated locations
(`.cursor/mcp.json`, `.vscode/mcp.json`, `~/.codex/config.toml`, …). So:

> **Critical adjustment #2.** "Home-based" means the **binary + shared telemetry
> store live in home as the single source of truth**; the framework still writes
> the **minimal native pointer config wherever each platform mandates it**. Those
> pointers exec the one home binary — which is *how* "single-binary update"
> actually propagates to hosts that never read `~/.agent-connector`.

Native config files (settings.json, config.toml, mcp.json) are **never** relocated
by `AGENT_CONNECTOR_DATA_DIR` — only framework-owned state is. (Generalized from
context-mode's `resolveContextModeDataRoot` / issue #649.)

### R3 — Per-project data, keyed by project identity, retained under home
> **Critical adjustment #3.** Telemetry/state is keyed by a stable **project
> identity** — `gitRemote || normalizedAbsPath`, hashed — and stored under the home
> data-root (default), **not by code location**. This survives `git clean`, isn't
> committed, and lets multiple platforms opening the same project share one store
> (the cross-agent shared-DB mechanism). In-repo storage is **opt-in**. Concurrent
> writers (several hosts at once) are handled by append-atomic NDJSON (MVP) or
> SQLite WAL (upgrade). Data is partitioned by `project_key` column → both
> per-project retention *and* cross-project rollups.

### R4 — Native Windows correctness, no symlink installs
Single binary must resolve home via the right per-OS dir (`%USERPROFILE%` /
`%APPDATA%` / XDG / `homedir()`), no POSIX-only assumptions, no symlink-based
installs. The Windows-safe spawn/quoting helpers (`buildNodeCommand` /
`parseNodeCommand`, fixing context-mode bugs #369/#372/#548/#738) are mandatory.

## 4. The common abstraction model

Distilled from the union of platform behaviors (report §3).

- **`ServerDef`** — transport-polymorphic server descriptor (`stdio | http | sse |
  ws`; `command/args/env/cwd` or `url/headers/auth`; `tools`, `timeoutMs`,
  `enabled`). Adapters render it into each dialect; **the root key is a per-adapter
  constant** (`mcpServers` | `servers` | `mcp` | `mcp_servers`), as are field-name
  differences (`cwd` vs `working_directory`, `env` vs `environment`, scalar
  `command` vs `command:[]`).
- **Transport capability set** — an adapter may reject/downgrade a transport it
  can't honor and *report* it (never crash).
- **Scope** — normalized ordered enum `{ system, user, project, profile, managed }`;
  each adapter maps to a concrete path + knows precedence. Default install scope =
  `user`; `--scope project` opt-in.
- **Normalized lifecycle events** — `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`,
  `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PreCompact`, `Stop`,
  `Notification`, `PermissionRequest`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `SubagentStart`,
  `SubagentStop` (12 canonical events — the last four are newer additions;
  hosts without a native analog mark them unsupported in capabilities and the
  install reports a skip-warn, never a silent drop). Mapped to each platform's names
  (`PreToolUse`↔`BeforeTool`↔`tool.execute.before`↔`pre_tool_call`). Normalized
  payload `{ toolName, toolInput, toolOutput?, isError?, sessionId, projectDir?,
  raw }`; normalized response `{ decision: allow|deny|modify|context|ask, reason?,
  updatedInput?, additionalContext?, updatedOutput? }`. The union is a floor, not
  a ceiling: host-only events (Claude Code alone ships 30) are reachable per
  platform via the `platforms.<id>.nativeHooks` passthrough — raw payload in,
  verbatim JSON reply out, exit 0 only; claude-code-only today
  (`supportsNativeHooks`), others skip-warn. An event is promoted into the union
  once ≥3 hosts ship a native analog (TaskCreated/TaskCompleted first candidates).
  Full contract: `llms-full.txt` §2.3.
- **Hook I/O paradigm taxonomy** (the deepest divergence — exactly three):
  - **`json-stdio`** (16) — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, VS Code Copilot,
    JetBrains Copilot, Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, Qwen, Kiro, Kimi, Crush, Goose,
    Hermes, Droid (Factory), Antigravity, Antigravity CLI. One universal hook
    entrypoint binary reads host JSON, the adapter normalizes it, the dev's
    handler runs, the adapter formats the reply.
  - **`ts-plugin`** (4) — OpenCode, Kilo CLI, OMP, OpenClaw. Framework
    *generates* an exported plugin module importing the dev's handler.
  - **`mcp-only`** (9) — Warp, Kilo, Roo Code, Trae, Zed, Amp, Codebuff, Mux,
    Pi. No hook layer; install only the MCP server; detection surfaces "hooks
    unavailable here."
- **`PlatformCapabilities`** flags (`preToolUse`, `postToolUse`, `preCompact`,
  `sessionStart`, `canModifyArgs`, `canModifyOutput`, `canInjectSessionContext`) —
  the single-API layer queries these and degrades gracefully.
- **Detection** — two layers: *install-time platform detection* (which hosts are
  installed: config-dir + marker files) and *runtime host detection* (which host is
  executing this hook now: env-var markers → config-dir → `clientInfo`). Generalized
  from context-mode's `registry.ts` + `detect.ts` (incl. fork-before-parent order &
  foreign-env scrubbing).
- **Escape hatch** — every adapter accepts `platforms.<id>.extra` passthrough so a
  dev reaches platform-exclusive features the core doesn't model. Thin universal
  core + fat per-adapter tail.
- **`memory` (the fourth content surface) & the AGENTS.md standard** — standing
  guidance declared once (`memory: [{ name?, description?, content }]`) and
  written by each supporting adapter as a **marker-fenced managed block** into
  the memory/rules file that host actually reads. Unlike commands / skills /
  subagents (files we wholly own), memory edits a SHARED, user-authored file —
  so every write goes through one dependency-free engine
  (`core/managed-block.ts`): markers
  `<!-- agent-connector:begin <connectorId>/<name> hash=<sha256-12> -->` …
  `<!-- agent-connector:end <connectorId>/<name> -->` plus a one-line
  do-not-edit notice; the blockId-on-the-marker makes multi-connector
  coexistence safe, and the hash (sha256-12 over the CRLF→LF-normalized,
  trimmed inner content) gives O(1) idempotence (unchanged → skip) and **edit
  detection** (inner hash ≠ recorded ⇒ user edited ⇒ warn-and-leave; overwrite
  only under `install --force` after a timestamped backup). Replacement is
  in-place — zero bytes outside the marker pair ever change; the scanner is
  line-anchored, CRLF-preserving, BOM-safe, and fence-aware. **AGENTS.md-first
  policy (grammar v1):** 27/29 hosts read the open AGENTS.md standard, so
  project scope targets `<projectDir>/AGENTS.md` — with exclusive/first-match
  readers PROBED so the block lands in the file the host will actually read
  (zed's first-match candidate list, warp's WARP.md priority, hermes'
  .hermes.md, opencode's CLAUDE.md fallback, codex's AGENTS.override.md;
  openclaw maps both scopes to its agent workspace) — and user scope the
  host's documented global memory file: AGENTS.md where one exists, else the
  host's own file (~/.qwen/QWEN.md, goose .goosehints,
  ~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md, kilo/roo/kiro rules-dir
  agent-connector.md), else skip-warn. The two exceptions follow
  their own official docs: claude-code → CLAUDE.md ("Claude Code reads
  CLAUDE.md, not AGENTS.md" — HTML-comment markers are stripped from Claude's
  context, invisible to the model yet parseable by us; opt-in
  `memory.mode: "agents-import"` manages the documented `@AGENTS.md` import as
  a ref-counted `_shared` bridge block instead) and gemini-cli → GEMINI.md
  (AGENTS.md only when `context.fileName` opts in). **We never edit host
  settings to make AGENTS.md readable — probe and respect only.** Install
  order: memory last among content surfaces, removed FIRST on uninstall;
  uninstall excises every block under the `<connectorId>/` marker prefix
  (markers in the file are the source of truth; the
  `connectorDir(id)/memory-state.json` ledger adds created-file deletion
  rights + doctor diagnostics: block present / hash intact / user-edited /
  file missing). Full contract: `llms-full.txt` §2.4.
- **`configPatch`** — the third (and smallest) escape hatch beside `extra` and
  `nativeHooks`: a declarative, ownership-tracked patch of ONE host-exclusive
  config key `extra` cannot reach (`extra` merges into the native MCP ENTRY /
  content frontmatter, not sibling top-level settings keys — e.g. Claude Code's
  `statusLine` or `env.CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`). Semantics are
  FIXED and not configurable: **set-if-absent on a single dotted leaf key**
  (segments `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`, no array indices, no deep merge, no overwrite, no
  delete), **skip-warn on ANY conflict** (present key, drifted value,
  non-object intermediate — every skip prints the exact manual edit from the
  required `reason` + optional `docsUrl`). Ownership lives in a persisted,
  refcounted ledger (`<dataRoot>/state/config-patches.json`, atomic writes):
  co-owners refcount a shared key; uninstall removes a key only when the LAST
  owner releases it AND the current value still deep-equals what was written
  AND the prior state was absent — otherwise the key is left in place with a
  warn. Doctor reports per-patch `ok / drifted / missing / orphaned` and never
  auto-fixes drift. Safety: keys agent-connector already models (`hooks*`,
  `mcpServers*`) are rejected at `defineConnector` (namespace guard), and each
  supporting adapter hard-refuses a documented sensitive-key denylist
  (claude-code: `permissions*`, `allowedTools*`/`disallowedTools*`, `apiKey*`,
  `awsAuthRefresh`/`awsCredentialExport`, `forceLoginMethod`/`forceLoginOrgUUID`,
  `otelHeadersHelper`, `env.ANTHROPIC_*`, `env.AWS_*`, `env.*_PROXY`,
  `env.*TOKEN*`/`env.*KEY*`/`env.*SECRET*`). v1 host scope: **claude-code only**
  (`supportsConfigPatch`); every other adapter reports the standard skip-warn
  (the `supportsNativeHooks` precedent) plus the per-patch manual edit.
  **Promotion rules:** (a) a second host gains `supportsConfigPatch` only on
  demonstrated, genuine connector-facing key demand for that host; (b) a
  host-exclusive feature graduates from `configPatch` to a typed cross-host
  knob (e.g. `statusline?: {…}`) only when **≥3 hosts** ship an analog — the
  same bar as hook-event promotion. **Format-preservation requirements for
  future hosts:** VS Code JSONC must use `jsonc-parser` modify/applyEdits and
  Codex `config.toml` must use an anchored section/line edit —
  `core/toml.ts`'s parse/stringify round-trip destroys comments/ordering and
  is **BANNED for configPatch**. **Explicitly NOT configPatch targets:**
  VS Code `inputs` arrays and Zed `context_servers.<id>.settings` — same-file
  sibling structures coupled to the MCP entry's lifecycle (adapter dialect /
  `extra` territory; VS Code `inputs` doubles as the secret-prompt mechanism).
  Also out of v1 scope (deferred, documented): TOML hosts (Codex's
  `experimental_use_rmcp_client` becomes codex-adapter-internal behavior when
  remote-MCP support lands), `onConflict`/`force` options, array/index paths,
  secret sourcing, sidecar/side-state files, prereq checks, and sync-removal
  of patches dropped between connector versions (uninstall/reinstall covers it).

## 5. What we borrow vs. generalize from context-mode

**Borrow (the mechanical spine):** the `HookAdapter` SPI shape, single-source
`ADAPTER_REGISTRY` + matrix test, runtime detection + disambiguators, Windows
spawn/quoting helpers, `BaseAdapter`, the data-root override, the 3-paradigm
taxonomy, capability flags, the thunk-based doctor.

**Generalize away (context-mode domain logic, must not leak into the framework):**
the hardcoded `"context-mode"` identity → becomes the dev-supplied `id`/entrypoint
parameter; baked-in hook scripts → synthesized from the dev's handlers; session /
memory / instruction-file / FTS / `bytes_avoided` logic → deleted from the SPI;
context-mode's analytics schema → replaced by our own minimal telemetry schema; the
4-bytes/token heuristic → demoted from default to *fallback* (a real tokenizer is
the default).

## 6. Telemetry architecture

- **Measure the server's own bytes** — the only data identical across hosts.
  Intercept every `tools/call` at the server boundary (via `agent-connector serve`
  proxy or in-proc middleware). input = `params.arguments`; output =
  `result.content[]` + `structuredContent`. Also tokenize `tools/list` schemas once
  → the fixed "cost of merely defining my tools" per-turn overhead.
- **Default = real tokenizer** — `gpt-tokenizer` (pure-JS, no native build →
  Windows/single-binary safe): `o200k_base` for OpenAI/Codex-family (labeled
  `tokenizer-exact`), and the same `o200k_base` as a documented approximation
  for every other family (labeled `tokenizer-approx`; no offline Claude
  tokenizer ships). Family auto-selected from `initialize.clientInfo` or
  `modelFamilyHint`.
- **Fallback = heuristic** — `chars/4` with content-type multipliers; **labeled
  `heuristic`** so it's never mistaken for exact. Non-text blocks: per-modality
  formulas, never tokenize base64.
- **Confidence tag** on every record: `tokenizer-exact | tokenizer-calibrated | tokenizer-approx |
  heuristic | host-native`.
- **Opt-in enrichers** (never the hot path): Anthropic `count_tokens` as a
  rate-limited calibration sampler (sends content off-box → opt-in only); host-native
  usage where it exists (Gemini `AfterModel.usageMetadata.totalTokenCount`).
- **Store** — local, at data-root, **aggregate counts only — never raw
  args/results**. MVP = append-atomic NDJSON event log + derived rollups behind a
  `TelemetryStore` interface (SQLite/WAL is a drop-in upgrade). Rows keyed by
  `connectorId, toolName, scope(call|tool_defs|model_turn|hook), surfaceKind(server|hook|command|skill|subagent), hostPlatform, sessionId,
  projectKey, projectDir, inputTokens, outputTokens, confidenceSource, isError, ts`.
- **Surface** — `agent-connector telemetry report [--by tool|session|project]
  [--since 7d] [--json]` → ranked per-tool footprint, tool-def overhead line,
  input/output split, calls, tokens/call avg, per-session/project rollups, with a
  visible confidence label; plus `telemetry export --format csv|json`.
- **Privacy / opt-out** — local-first, zero egress by default; granular kill
  switches `AGENT_CONNECTOR_TELEMETRY=0` (global) + per-layer (measure / calibrate /
  upload); hashable aggregation keys; dashboards state numbers are estimates from
  the server's own I/O, not host-billed usage.

## 7. Public API (write once)

```ts
import { defineConnector } from "@ken-jo/agent-connector";

export default defineConnector({
  id: "acme-db",
  displayName: "Acme DB Tools",
  version: "1.0.0",

  server: {                                  // declared ONCE, transport-polymorphic
    transport: "stdio",
    command: "npx",
    args: ["-y", "@acme/db-mcp"],
    env: { ACME_DB_DSN: "${env:ACME_DB_DSN}" },   // universal ${env:VAR} / ${env:VAR:-default}
    tools: { include: ["*"] },
  },

  hooks: {                                   // normalized events; framework synthesizes per paradigm
    PreToolUse: {
      matcher: "acme_query|acme_write",
      async handler(evt) {
        if (evt.toolName === "acme_write") return { decision: "ask", reason: "Confirm write" };
        return { decision: "allow" };
      },
    },
  },

  memory: [{                                 // standing guidance → managed marker block in each
    content: "Use the acme-db MCP tools for schema questions; never hand-edit migrations.",
  }],                                        // host's memory file (AGENTS.md-first; CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md exceptions)

  telemetry: { enabled: true, modelFamilyHint: "auto", measureToolDefs: true },

  platforms: {                               // per-platform escape hatch / overrides
    warp: { hooks: false },                  // mcp-only host: skip hooks gracefully
  },
  targets: "auto",                           // or ["claude-code","codex","cursor"]
});
```

## 8. CLI

Install per target: `backupSettings()` → render server config into native file →
if hooks & paradigm≠mcp-only: synthesize entrypoint + write hook config + set exec
bit → register in plugin registry where applicable → return change list. Everything
idempotent, reversible, `--dry-run`-able.

## 9. MVP scope & phasing

- **Phase 0 — core spine** (no platforms): contracts, `defineConnector` + validation,
  interpolation, registry/detection, spawn helpers, data-root/paths, doctor harness,
  CLI skeleton.
- **Phase 1 — MVP: 3 maximally-divergent, high-confidence platforms + telemetry core.**
  **Claude Code** (JSON, `mcpServers`, richest hooks), **Codex CLI** (TOML, env split,
  trust gates), **Cursor** (JSON + `${env:}` interpolation + `hooks.json` v1). This
  trio alone exercises JSON+TOML, three hook dialects, env-var detection, and the
  whole `json-stdio` path end-to-end. Ship telemetry core here (it's platform-
  independent by design).
- **Phase 2 — breadth on json-stdio + first host-native telemetry + first mcp-only:**
  VS Code Copilot, Copilot CLI, Gemini (wire `AfterModel` host-native enricher), Warp.
- **Phase 3 — `ts-plugin` paradigm:** OpenCode, Kilo, Hermes (the hard adapters).
- **Phase 4 — verification-gated long tail:** JetBrains, Pi, OpenClaw, zed/antigravity/
  kiro/qwen/kimi/omp.
